 
2015 Spring --Data Visualization Project
---------------

# Topic
We will be collecting data from Yelp, Foursquare and other alike websites that generously provide awsome data, to do an interesting visualized analysis about New Yorkers' dining activities. Initial thoughts are "Good/bad restaurant map", "Best places for pizza in Mahattan", "My activities map".

*Collaborations and advices are welcomed!!!!*
