 
2015 Spring --Data Visualization Project
---------------

# Topic
We will be collecting data from Yelp, Foursquare and other alike websites who generally provide awsome data, to do an interesting visualized analysis about New Yorkers' dining activities. Initial thoughts are "Good/bad restaurant map", "Places for awsome pizza in Mahattam", "My activities map".

*Collaboration and advices are welcomed!!!!*
